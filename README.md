# How I made this
I wanted to create a project to search Google with a flash file. I redid the old Google logo etc. 
I ended up failing for a second, but then I found a tutorial that shows you how to Google Search with  ActionScript 3.0. And I thought if it worked the same with ActionScript 2.0 because you know, I'm used with ActionScript 2.0. And yes, it worked! So I ended up succeeding the project.
# How to use
Coming soon...
